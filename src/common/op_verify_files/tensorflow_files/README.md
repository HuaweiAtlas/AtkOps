This directory is used to store files related to the TensorFlow custom operator, including two categories:

(1) A list of unsupported operators generated by the network analysis module

(2) A single-operator model generated by the get_tf_model_and_data.py file that only includes the input layer and custom operator layer. Note that the get_tf_model_and_data.py file will delete the original .om and .pb files in the directory and generate the .pb file of the single-operator model.
